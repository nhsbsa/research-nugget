### 'Am I Exempt' Service
# Research Nugget 1
## Q: How could we improve this service?

> “You can’t but please ask the department that sends penalty notices out to [people with] exempt medical conditions to at least [send] a first letter to ask them to use this service to check if they have a valid certificate …”
 
>“… to get a fine … and to pay for four prescriptions in one month has been very upsetting and stressful…” “…an insulin dependent diabetic … for thirty years … [is] worrying about the cost of his next prescriptions…”
